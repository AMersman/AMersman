I'm passionate about data science and have been teaching myself for over a year, continually working to increase my skill set. I have spent the past 11 years as an analytical chemist and the past 5 years focusing on Data Analysis using RDBMS, SQL and Excel Data Visualization. I love data to answer questions and solve business problems. I have a passion for finding solutions and data cleaning. I enjoy puzzles and that means I like finding pieces that fit together even when the work is tedious.
