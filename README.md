I'm a Data Science Fellow at Springboard working on Machine Learning. I have spent the past 11 years as an analytical chemist and the past 5 years focusing on Data Analysis using SQL and Excel for Dashboards and Data Visualization. I have a passion for finding solutions and data cleaning. I enjoy puzzles and that means I like finding pieces that fit together even when the work is tedious. 

I know SQL and python and love using Tableau to create Data Visualizations.
