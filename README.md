I'm passionate about data science and have been teaching myself for over a year, continually working to increase my skill sey. I have spent the past 11 years as an analytical chemist and the past 5 years focusing on Data Analysis using SQL and Excel for Dashboards and Data Visualization. I love using python to solve business problems. I have a passion for finding solutions and data cleaning. I enjoy puzzles and that means I like finding pieces that fit together even when the work is tedious.
